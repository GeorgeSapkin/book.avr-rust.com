# 2.1. Installing required third party tools


A number of third party tools are required to use AVR Rust.

* avr-gcc (only used as a linker frontend)
* avr-binutils (for linker support)
* avr-libc (for device-specific runtime libraries)

These should be installed by the operating system package manager.

## Arch Linux

To install all required dependencies under Arch Linux, run

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S avr-gcc avr-libc
```

## Ubuntu

To install all required dependencies under Ubuntu Linux, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install binutils gcc-avr avr-libc
```
